# Invoice_Extraction
This Streamlit-based Invoice Extraction App is designed to automate the extraction of structured data from invoice images. Users can upload either a ZIP file containing multiple invoice images or individual image files (e.g., PNG, JPG, JPEG). The app processes these images to extract key details such as:

Invoice Number
Date
Vendor Name
Items List (with name, quantity, and price)
Total Amount
Using advanced AI models like Ollama Llama3.2 for image-based extraction, the app converts unstructured image data into a structured format (JSON). This structured data is then organized into a table with relevant information, which users can easily view, download as a CSV, or further process.
